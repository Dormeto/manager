# Changelog

Versions of the Dormeto manager, each with the router version it installs. Releases:
https://releases.dormeto.com/manager/ (install: https://dormeto.com/get-started.html).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-06

Router 0.22.6.

- Installed with a Terraform module from a release (`terraform-aws-dormeto-<version>.zip//modules/manager`), carrying
  the manager's built code and the router it installs; optional custom domain and SES identity (without, Cognito sends
  the invitations); `deletion_protection` for the users.
- Organization access without CloudFormation: the `dormeto-access` and `dormeto-organization` modules or the AWS CLI
  script of the release, shared by several environments; both roles checked at each discovery run, the Organization
  access panel, onboarding and router installs refused where the command role is missing.
- Scale to 1,000 accounts: routers push their state, discovery fanned out by account, bulk onboarding.
- Onboarding, offboarding and router installation by API calls; router management (health, pause, exclusions);
  organization discovery with filters and multi-rule workloads.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-04

- First version: dashboard and API on the routers written in Terraform, nap and wake, discovery of the load balancer
  rules Dormeto could manage.
